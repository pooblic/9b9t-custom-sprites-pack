# The 9b9t Custom Sprites Pack
Created by [kyogreisreal](https://github.com/kyogreisreal) AKA Frenchie, this pack uses [MCPatcher](https://bitbucket.org/prupe/mcpatcher) (built into Optifine) to deliver funny 9b9t-themed custom sprites based on NBT data. This is not a serious project.

If you'd like to add a sprite, check the [MCPatcher Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/prupe/mcpatcher/wiki/Home) for information and examples.
